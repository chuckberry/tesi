In this work we have investigated behaviour of task-affinity on different architectures. Task-affinity is based on assumption that, if tasks share a great 
amount of data and we have an SMP architecture, then occasionally executing them on the first available processors will increase the cache-miss rate. If we 
move tasks to be executed near to where data was produced, then we spare some cache-misses \cite{lcs}. We have demonstrate that this assumption is not 
always true. Migrations of tasks play an important role on predictability of the applications. When a task migrates, data could be moved from one cache to 
another. As we have seen with Intel Xeon and as it is demonstrated in \cite{molka}, this operation may involve high latency that depends on cache 
architecture and inter-chip communications and other hardware factors. Therefore it is clear that it is not enough to execute tasks that share common data 
on the same CPUs, but it is necessary guarantee that tasks that share common data find what they need possibly in L1 cache. For this reason, we have 
improved the concept of temporal locality.

The experimental results showed there is an improvement of TODO

%TODO come si vede la task-affinity \'e fortemente dipendente dall\'architettura la patch non va bene per linux perch\'e serve una politica di migration
%TODO pi\'u decente

%the first goal of this thesis is to investigate how task-affinity behaves on different architectures. questo \'e stato fatto perch\'e as showed in molka
%le cache scassano il cazzo sono complicate devo dire che la task-aff \'e troppo semplicistica ecc.. ... riempi.. for this reasons it is necessary how taskaffinity
